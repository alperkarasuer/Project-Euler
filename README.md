# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/), a website dedicated to a wide array of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. These problems range from simple calculations to more demanding problems that require an in-depth understanding of mathematics and algorithms.

The primary goal of sharing these solutions is educational, to demonstrate problem-solving and coding skills, and to invite discussions and improvements from the community.

## Structure

Each solution is organized by problem number. The solutions are primarily written in Python, although some problems may be solved in multiple languages for comparative learning purposes.
